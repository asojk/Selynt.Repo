# Welcome!

This is a modern web application built with a robust stack of technologies including Vite, ReactJS, and TypeScript, complemented by TailwindCSS for styling and ESLint/Prettier for code quality. Here's a quick guide to help you get started and contribute effectively:

## Project Purpose

This project is designed to be a dynamic and responsive web application, leveraging the latest front-end technologies to ensure a smooth development experience and high performance.

## Key Components

React & TypeScript: Core technologies for building interactive and type-safe UI components.
Vite: A fast build tool that enhances development speed and efficiency.
TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Testing & Linting: Vitest and Testing Library for testing, ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code quality.


##  Basic Structure

`public`: Contains static assets like images and configuration files.
`scripts`: Includes TypeScript scripts for handling tasks like image uploads and changes.
`src`: The heart of the application, containing:
Page Components: Home.tsx, About.tsx, etc.
Reusable Components: Found in the components directory.
Utilities and Libraries: Located in the lib directory.
Routing and Pages: Managed within the pages directory.
Type Definitions: Stored in the types directory for TypeScript.


## Getting Started
1. Install Dependencies: Run pnpm install to set up the project.
2. Development Server: Use npm run dev to start the Vite development server and see your changes live.
3. Build & Lint: Use pnpm run build to compile the application and npm run lint to check for code quality issues.


###  Contribution Tips
Familiarize yourself with the directory structure and key components.
Follow the coding standards enforced by ESLint and Prettier.
Use the provided scripts for tasks like image handling to maintain consistency.
